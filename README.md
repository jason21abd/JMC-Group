# JMC — Jason Management and Consultants

**Author**: Jason Abdallah  
**API Used**: Intended to use the "Quote of the Day" API, but due to technical issues, the final version was submitted without an active API connection.

## Project Description

JMC (Jason Management and Consultants) is a consulting company website designed with responsiveness and user experience in mind. The project includes multiple pages and a unique double navigation bar. The primary navigation bar is always visible, while a secondary navigation bar smoothly appears when the user scrolls upward—enhancing accessibility without cluttering the screen. The website is fully responsive across desktop and mobile platforms. On mobile devices, only the main navigation bar is shown, accompanied by a burger menu for simplified navigation.

## Custom Requirement

To meet the custom feature requirement of a **modal popup for detailed item views**, two implementations were included:
1. A modal on the **Subscribe** page that appears when users choose to sign up for the newsletter.
2. A modal on the **Careers** page triggered when users apply for an open position.

These modals provide a clean and interactive user experience, guiding users through critical actions without leaving the current page.
